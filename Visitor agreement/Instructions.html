You may also display a link to, or the address of, the page of our Automotive Network on which any VSC appears. </p>

		<p class="bye">Promotions and Solicitations</p>

		<p class="bye">You agree that, except with our prior consent, you will not upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise use the Forums to make or distribute any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, contests, sweepstakes, survey requests or promotional materials, to campaign for any political cause, or to implore Visitors to take actions that are intended to further a personal or commercial purpose. </p>

		<p>This Community Service provides you with an opportunity to describe your experience with a particular dealership and to comment on the experiences of other reviewers. </p>

		<p>To facilitate the free flow of useful information about these businesses, we have established a number of "rules of the road" for posting a review or comment: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your review should describe what your experience was like, with facts and not fluff. Stay on-topic. We do not publish reviews that do not provide information about the reviewer's personal experience. Reviews that do not provide sufficient detail concerning that experience may be rejected as unhelpful to our Visitors. </li>
			<li>You may not submit a review of your experience if you have been offered any payment or other incentive to do so, or if you have a personal relationship with the owner or any of the employees of the dealership. </li>
			<li>Your review must describe an experience that occurred within the past two years. </li>
			<li>While we do permit you to include your description of and frank opinion about your experience, we do not permit "name-calling" or the use of profanity. </li>
			<li>We do not permit the posting of ads or solicitations, HTML or links, or personal contact information (e.g., telephone numbers, email addresses) for you or others. </li>
			<li>You may include the name of any salesperson or other individual with whom you dealt but to reiterate not his or her telephone number, email address or other contact information.
			<li>Please do not write in ALL CAPS. </li>
			<li>A comment can be positive or negative, ask questions and/or provide supporting information.</li>
		</ul><span style="font-size: 20px;">Read More....</span>
		<p class="bye">Please note that, after a review is submitted, it may not be revised or deleted by you and we will not do so if requested. However, you may add additional information concerning your experience by submitting an update. </p>

		<p class="bye">While we ask that our Visitors not post reviews and comments that are defamatory or otherwise inaccurate, and that they refrain from offensive personal descriptions or incivility, we do not remove a review or comment in response to allegations that it contains defamatory language or inaccuracies, or because it may be offensive to some people. </p>

		<p class="bye">We have a policy of not posting a review that we know, or have reason to believe, is not a genuine reflection of a consumer's experience at a dealership. However, we do not remove a review in response to an allegation that it is not genuine unless we are presented with persuasive extrinsic evidence. </p>

		<p class="bye">We do not make any promises as to what actions we will or will not take with respect to any review or comment, and no such promises should be inferred from either this Visitor Agreement or any communication by us. </p>

		<p class="bye">Dealers and their representatives have the ability to comment on the reviews of their businesses. However any person associated with the business, either personally or professionally, must disclose that relationship in his or her comment. If you represent a dealership, please visit our and download our Information Sheet; it includes tips on how best to engage and benefit from our Dealer Ratings and Reviews. </p>

		<p class="bye">It is a violation of this Visitor Agreement for you to (i) create, submit or post any review on behalf of another person, (ii) create, submit or post any review that is not a bona fide reflection of your actual experience, or (iii) advise or induce anyone else to create or submit, or to participate or assist anyone in the creation or posting of, any review that is not a bona fide reflection of the actual experience of the person submitting that review. Anyone who violates the foregoing prohibition will be subject to legal recourse by us, including claims for damages and/or for indemnification as provided below. </p>

		<p><strong>Vehicle Ratings and Reviews</strong></p>

		<p>This Community Service provides you with an opportunity to describe your experience with a particular vehicle and to comment on the experience of other reviewers. In an effort to provide Visitors with the most valuable consumer insight and information, we have established a number of "rules of the road" for posting a review or comment: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Please only write a review if you have had hands-on experience with the vehicle. Please limit your review to the facts and details of your experience driving the vehicle, and do not include facts or details about the dealership from which you may have purchased or leased the vehicle. (If you desire to describe your experience at the dealership, please submit a Dealer Review.) </li>
			<li>You may not submit a vehicle review if you have been offered any payment or other incentive to do so. If you or a member of your household is associated with any automotive manufacturer, dealer or advertising agency for an automotive manufacturer or dealer, or with a supplier to the automotive industry, you are required to disclose that relationship in your review or comment. </li>
			<li>Please do not use profanity in your review text. </li>
			<li>We do not permit the posting of for-sale ads or solicitations, HTML or links, or personal contact information (e.g., telephone numbers, email addresses) for you or for others. </li>
			<li>Please do not write in ALL CAPS. </li>
			<li>A comment can be positive or negative, ask questions and/or provide supporting information.</li>
		</ul><span style="font-size: 20px;">Read More....</span>
		<p class="bye">Please note that, after a review is submitted, it may not be deleted by you and we will not do so if requested. However, you may edit or update a review by clicking the "update your review" button located beneath your review, or by following the instructions sent to you by email following publication of your review. </p>

		<p class="bye">We do not make any promises as to what actions we will or will not take with respect to any review or comment, and no such promises should be inferred from either this Visitor Agreement or any communication by us. </p>

		<p><strong>Availability of Community Services</strong></p>

		<p>While we make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Community Services are available at all times, we do not guarantee that the Community Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, and we do not guarantee that Visitors will be able to access or use all the Community Services or all of their features at all times. </p>

		<p>We may change, suspend or discontinue any or all Community Services, or any or all of their features, at any time. We may also impose limits on your access to or use of certain features of the Community Services, or restrict your access to any or all of the Community Services, in all cases without notice to you or liability to us. </p>

		<p><strong>Community Services Security; Violations of Law</strong></p>

		<p>We may investigate incidents involving such violations, any violations of this Visitor Agreement that may constitute or have the potential to constitute violations of law, and any activity by Visitors on our Automotive Network that constitute or may constitute violations of law. You understand that we may report any such activity to, and cooperate with, law enforcement, with or without receipt by us of a subpoena or other legal process. </p>
